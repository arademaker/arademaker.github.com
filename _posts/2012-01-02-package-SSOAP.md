================

Last year, during a summer course that I gave at FGV, I taught the
students how to use SOAP protocol do retrive data from
[Banco Central do Brasil](http://bcb.gov.br/) using R. BCB has a
system called SGS (Sistema Gerenciador de Séries Temporais) that has a
SOAP interface.

At that time, the [package SSOAP](http://www.omegahat.org/SSOAP/) had
a small bug that I contributed to fix. Today I found that my
contribution was incorporated in
[version 0.5-5](http://www.omegahat.org/SSOAP/Changes.html) of this
package whish makes my
[repository at github](https://github.com/arademaker/SSOAP) outdated.

It took my a couple of minutes to test the new version of this
package. Since I am running the last version of R, 2.14, the general
procedure for install packages didn't work.

    > install.packages("SSOAP")
    Warning message:
    In getDependencies(pkgs, dependencies, available, lib) :
      package ‘SSOAP’ is not available (for R version 2.14.0)

I finnaly figured out how to install the last version from source
using the Omegahat repository version with the command:

    > install.packages("SSOAP", repos = "http://www.omegahat.org/R", 
                       dependencies = TRUE, 
                       type = "source")
    trying URL 'http://www.omegahat.org/R/src/contrib/SSOAP_0.8-1.tar.gz'
    Content type 'application/x-gzip' length 195424 bytes (190 Kb)
    opened URL

After that, I was prepared to actually test the package running the
code that I created during the
[course](https://github.com/arademaker/IR-2011/) (lesson 7 directory
aula-07). But some changes in RCurl package requires a replacement of
the argument `ssl.verifypeer = FALSE` by `.opts = list(ssl.verifypeer
= FALSE)` in the call of the function
`ff@functions$getValoresSeriesXML`. The last version of this script is now available as a gist here:
