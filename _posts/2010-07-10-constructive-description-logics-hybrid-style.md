================

Constructive modal logics come in several different flavours and
constructive description logics, not surprisingly, do the same. We
introduce an intuitionistic description logic, which we call iALC (for
intuitionistic ALC, since ALC is the name of the canonical description
logic system) and provide axioms, a Natural Deduction formulation and
a sequent calculus for it. The system iALC is related to Simpsonʼs
constructive modal logic IK the same way Mendler and Scheeleʼs cALC is
related to constructive CK and in the same way classical multimodal K
is related to ALC. In the system iALC, as well as in cALC, the
classical principles of the excluded middle C⊔¬C=T, double negation
¬¬C=C and the definitions of the modalities ∃R.C=¬∀R.¬C and
∀R.C=¬∃R.¬C are no longer validities, but simply non-trivial TBox
statements used to axiomatize specific application
scenarios. Meanwhile in iALC, like in classical ALC, we have that the
distribution of existential roles over disjunction
i.e. ∃R.(C⊔D)=∃R.C⊔∃R.D and (the nullary case) ∃R.⊥=⊥ hold, which is
not true for cALC. We intend to use iALC for modelling juridical
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and we describe briefly how.
