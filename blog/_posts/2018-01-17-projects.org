As I wrote in the comments on [[https://github.com/ha-mo-we/Racer/issues/4][this issue]], it would be a nice project
to improve Wilbur and Racer2 making them more modular and robust. It
is a shame the current support for RDF/OWL in Lisp, it is almost
nothing compare with Python and Java libraries available such as:

- https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- https://jena.apache.org

The only robust library available for RDF/OWL in Lisp is the Allegro
Graph system from Franz, but it is a commercial and since its 3.X
version, it can't be used as a library for simples RDF/OWL
manipulations.

I found https://github.com/SeijiKoide/SWCLOS but I haven't tried it
yet. The ideas didn't not evolved so much since the paper
[[http://www.iiia.csic.es/~puyol/TAPIA2001/use-of-lisp-on-sw.pdf][The Use of Lisp in Semantic Web Applications]].
