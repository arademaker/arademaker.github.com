Guilherme Passos presented last week his final undergrad
project. Congratulations Guilherme, well done. The project is an
extension of the ideas from the book:

P. Blackburn and J. Bos, Representation and inference for natural
language. 2005

Guilherme expands the code from the book to use the Princeton Wordnet
for making a simple conversational chatbot that can understand some
sentences (basically all type of sentences considered in the book)
module some hyponyms and hypernyms from PWN, and provide some answers
to the user. The links for the code and texts will be available soon
here.
