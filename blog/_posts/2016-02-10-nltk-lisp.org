1. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sciencv/ and http://lattes.cnpq.br are
   similar efforts to provide a system and data model for researchers
   resumes. Besides all private services with similar aim, like
   https://www.researchgate.net, https://www.academia.edu, and
   http://orcid.org. We also have https://github.com/openrif and
   https://www.eagle-i.net
   (https://open.med.harvard.edu/project/eagle-i/) as a open-source
   initiatives for suggest a open model for that domain. How to
   compare all these projects and services? Many more not listed here
   are available, of course. How to map those different data models?
