During the evaluation of a paper, I read about the PARSEME annotation
guidelines of verbal multiword expression. 

The question that came to my mind was, what would happen if we process
PARSEME data with ERG grammar? Would it be possible to associate to
each type of verbal construction a pattern in the MRS?
