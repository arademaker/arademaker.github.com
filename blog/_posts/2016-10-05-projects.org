We need Common Lisp libraries for Linked Data and related
technologies:

- http://json-ld.org :: some initial attempt made from [[https://github.com/RDProjekt/cl-json-ld][cl-json-ld]] and
     maybe some references from [[http://allegrograph.com/rdf-json/][Franz's code]].

- http://owlapi.sourceforge.net :: some references at [[http://www.cliki.net/rdf][cliki]].

I would be very happy to supervise a work (undergrad or masters) to
develop such libraries in Common Lisp.
