We have presented the paper [[/bibliography/lrec-2016-morpholinks.html][Semantic Links for Portuguese]] in the
LREC 2016. As we already know, the paper is not the end of this work,
possible the contrary of that. We already know some improvements
needed and some related works that we sill have to analyse. This post
is to register these information and list possible future works for
the article.

Thanks, Diana Santos for suggesting me the works:

- Medeiros, José Carlos, Rui Marques & Diana Santos. [[http://www.linguateca.pt/Diana/download/Medeirosetal93.pdf][Português
  Quantitativo]], Actas do 1.o Encontro de Processamento de Língua
  Portuguesa (Escrita e Falada) - EPLP'93, (Lisboa, 25-26 de Fevereiro
  de 1993).

- Alina Villalva, [[https://www.uam.es/gruposinv/upstairs/upstairs2/curricula/trabajos/villalva_1995_estructuras.pdf][Estruturas Morfológicas]], thesis, Lisboa, 1994.

- Another [[http://lattes.cnpq.br/0344501785488249][thesis]]

- Articles in PROPOR or EBRALC or ELC from Violeta Quertal.

We still need more experiments with corpora. Possible verifying the
cases of zero-derivational words. We can use a generator of verbs
forms (conjugator) for help the annotation of candidates.

We have cases like 'aparecer', 'aparição', 'aparecimento' and
'aparência'. All of them must be in the resource. Other cases are
'coberta' and 'cobertura'. Valid cases should also be in the resource
but are not frequent enough to appear in the corpus (ex: 'eu
/governo/').

Ambiguities versus fine-grained classification. The semantic links
/ação/ and /resultado/ do make sense in Portuguese? If the introduce
too many classes (using classes from other languages), we are creating
a problem not dealing with one real problem.
