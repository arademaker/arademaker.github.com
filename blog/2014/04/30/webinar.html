  <h1> VIVO Apps and Tools Webinar </h1>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Yerterday I presented for the Apps and Tools working group my workflow
  to prepared data to be inserted into FGV VIVO instance. Since some
  people asked be to share the links and the file that I used to guide
  the presentation, I made this post.</p>
<p>This page is generated from a <a href="http://orgmode.org">org file</a> that I export to HTML and
  further processed with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. The process of use org files with
  jekyll is outlined <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-jekyll.html">here</a>. I plan to improve this workflow, but it is
  working for my personal website and for the websites of the courses
  that I teach at FGV.</p>
<h1>The Toolset</h1>
<p>This is the non comprehensive list of tools that I use. I am listing
  here the main tools that come up into my mind that should be
  interesting to others.</p>

  <li><a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net">tidy</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Data Sources</h1>
<p>We have to main sources of data: (1) the FGV researchers&#8217; curricula
  vitae from <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br">Lattes Platform</a> and; (2) the FGV digital library.</p>
<p>During the webinar I shared my screen and presented the web interface
  that <a href="http://cnpq.br">CNPq</a> provides for researchers update their resumes. I also shown
  <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/0675365413696898">my curriculum vitae</a> and discussed why I do not consider Brazilian
  Researchers curricula vitae open data given the captcha that blocks
  crawlers to get XML files from the Lattes website in a batch mode.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention during the webinar but one of my old dreams is to
  convice CNPq to add <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> or https://schema.org microformats into the
  HTML pages of the curricula vitae. This would not only allow crawlers
  to easier process the data but could also facilitate the maintainance
  of the system. My current XSLT transformation of Lattes XML to RDF
  cloud provide the starting point to RDFa embeeding.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/dspace">FGV Digital Library</a> runs Dspace. The publications and collections
  metadata are easly collected from Dspace using the <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">OAI-PMH protocol</a>.</p>
<h1>Lattes XML Files</h1>
<p>As I said in the previous section, the curricula vitae of Brazilian
  Researchers are not open data, that is, they are not public available
  in structured format. They are only public available as HTML pages in
  the Lattes website, with limited search interface. The only way to
  universities and research institutions get the curricula vitae of
  their researchers in a structured format is to sign an <a href="http://www.cnpq.br/web/portal-lattes/acordos-institucionais">aggrement</a> with
  CNPq. FGV has signed this aggrement and we have one server authorized
  to access CNPq web server to retrive the XML files of all curriculae
  that have informed any professional activity with FGV.</p>
<p>To transform the Lattes files to RDF, I use a XSLT transformation that
  I developed few years ago. The XSLT is freely available at github in
  the repository <a href="https://github.com/arademaker/SLattes">Semantic Lattes</a>.</p>
<p>In this repo, I made also available the DTD that I try hard to keep
  up-to-date. Unfortunately, until recently, CNPq did not make public
  annoucement of chances in the structure of the XML files that they
  produce, so I had to adapt the DTD whenever I identify changes. I have
  just found in the end of <a href="http://www.cnpq.br/web/portal-lattes/extracoes-de-dados">this page</a> that CNPq finally realized the
  importance of making available the updated DTD. Nevertheless, the DTD
  in the link of this page is outdated. At least, using this DTD to
  validate the 489 FGV&#8217;s curriculae I got more than 100 erros but using
  my DTD to validate the same files I got only 2 errors. Considering
  that those 489 files were produced my CNPq, we have two options: (1)
  the DTD is outdated; or (2) the code that produces the XML files has
  bugs. The two erros that I find using my DTD occur only with two
  curriculae that were not updated in the last 2 years.</p>
<p>After download the XML files, the general idea to process them and
  produce the RDF files is outlined in the code below:</p>
<pre class="src" lang="sh">
for f in $ROOT/ontos/xml/*.xml; do
    ID=$(basename $f .xml)
    echo Processing $ID
    xmllint --noout --dtdvalid $REPO/LMPLCurriculo.DTD $f 2&gt;&gt; error.log
    xsltproc --stringparam ID $ID $REPO/lattes.xsl $f &gt; $ID.rdf  
done
</pre>
<p>After that, I import the RDF files to Allegro Graph making each
  curriculum a separated graph so I can easly identify the provenance of
  each triple. The importation is done using the <a href="http://franz.com/agraph/support/documentation/current/agload.html">agload</a> utility. The
  load process takes aprox. 2 minutes:</p>
<pre class="example">
Load finished 487 sources in 00:02:03 (123.02 seconds).  
Triples added: 1,690,538 
Average Rate: 13742.00 tps
</pre>
<h1>Data Deduplication</h1>
<p>I briefly commented about the deduplication of records during the
  webinar. I do have to take care of removing duplicated resources about
  the same entity. Considering a thesis defended by and student at FGV
  whom have as advisor a professor at FGV. I will have metadata
  (triples) about this thesis from three different sources: (1) the RDF
  produced from the advisor&#8217;s curriculum lattes XML; (2) the RDF produce
  from the student&#8217;s curriculum lattes XML; and (3) the RDF obtained
  from the FGV Digital Library.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://github.com/arademaker/vivo-code">current code</a> that I use to identify duplicated resources is a
  Common Lisp library that is easily used if placed inside the
  local-projects directory of a <a href="http://www.quicklisp.org/">Quicklisp</a> instalation.</p>
<p>I can write an entire article only about deduplication in RDF. I am
  still thinking hard about this problem and really would like to find
  better alternatives.  One can note that deduplication of nodes in a
  RDF graph should not be done type by type as I am doing now. The rules
  to identify resources as being refering the same entity could
  dependent each other. That is, the deduplication of instances of
  <code>foaf:Person</code> can activate the rule to deduplicate instances of
  <code>bibo:Article</code> and vice-versa. It would be better to have a kind of
  fixed point transformation in the RDF graph that could keep clustering
  nodes until nothing more can be done. As a logician, I am very
  interested in approach this problem in a more declarative and
  deductive way.</p>
<p>I also have to note that <code>owl:sameAs</code> semantics doesn&#8217;t help here. I
  do use <code>owl:sameAs</code> to mark the nodes that should be merged but I have
  to merge the nodes after all <code>owl:sameAs</code> triples are produced. I do
  this with two SPARQL construct queries:</p>
<pre class="example">
delete { ?s1 ?p ?o . }
insert { ?s2 ?p ?o . }
where {
  ?s1 owl:sameAs ?s2 .
  ?s1 ?p ?o .
  filter( !sameTerm(?p, owl:sameAs) )
}
</pre>
<pre class="example">
delete { ?x ?p ?o1 . }
insert { ?x ?p ?o2 . }
where {
  ?o1 owl:sameAs ?o2 .
  ?x ?p ?o1 .
  filter( !sameTerm(?p, owl:sameAs) )
}
</pre>
<p>Note that the filters block the propagation of the <code>owl:sameAs</code>
  triples.</p>
<h1>Mapping Lattes RDF to VIVO RDF</h1>
<p>To map the Lattes RDF model produced by my XSLT to the expected VIVO
  RDF model, I have to look carefully to each instance of data. This
  mapping is not completed but at this point I have already mapped most
  of the data about people, publication, research areas and
  departaments.</p>
<p>To work on the rules and queries to transform the data, I used the
  query and data browsing tools developed by Franz: Gruff and
  AllegroGraph WebView. During the webinar I presented both systems.</p>
<p>The mapping is developed as rules that were easly tested with CWM. One
  example of rules is</p>
<pre class="example">
{ ?dept foaf:member ?person ;
        rdf:type foaf:Group . } =&gt; 
{ [ vivo:relates ?dept ;
    vivo:relates ?person ;
    a vivo:FacultyPosition ;
    rdfs:label &quot;Professor Adjunto&quot;@pt ] . } .
</pre>
<p>Rules like the one above are placed in an n3 file and executed by CWM
  that receives the rule file and the data file and produces the data
  output file. Unfortunately, CWM does not have good performance and I
  haven&#8217;t even tried to use it with all the data. I develop the rules
  and test them with only one curriculum vitae file.</p>
<p>Once I finish to test the rules, I rewrite them as SPARQL queries. The
  one above becomes:</p>
<pre class="example">
insert 
{ graph &lt;http://www.fgv.br/vivo/import/&gt; 
  {            
   [ vivo:relates ?dept ;
     vivo:relates ?person ;
      a vivo:FacultyPosition ;
     rdfs:label &quot;Professor Adjunto&quot;@pt ] . 
  }
}
where
{ ?dept foaf:member ?person ;
        rdf:type foaf:Group . 
}
</pre>
<p>Note that: (1) the query produces blank nodes that need to be
  transformed into normal nodes before loaded into VIVO; (2) All created
  triples are placed in a separated graph; and (3) if this query is
  executed twice it will generate duplicated and dispensable
  triples. This is the most important limitation of using SPARQL for
  me. CWM will only execute a rule whenever necessary and the rules do
  not have to explicit declare any condition to avoid unnecessary
  creation of triples.</p>
<p>It is still not clear to me if all SPARQL queries can be rewrited to
  prevent non necessary creation of triples. Moreover, I don&#8217;t want to
  have too complicated SPARQL queries to maintain.</p>
<p>More on the next post.</p>
