                  contextualized ontologies and an approach to specify
                  context-aware systems. The algebra is designed to
                  support context moddeling and aims at the
                  specification of modular and scalable description of
                  arbitrarily complex systems. It takes
                  contextualization as a basic notion and proposes a
                  small set of simple and powerful operations to
                  compose and decompose contextualized entities. The
                  specification approach considers the gap between the
                  formal specification and the real application and
                  represent the specification process in three kinds
                  of diagrams variyng from the system design to the

  abstract =    {Description Logics (DLs) is a family of formalisms
                  used to represent knowledge of a domain. They are
                  equipped with a formal logic-based
                  semantics. Knowledge representation systems based on
                  description logics provide various inference
                  capabilities that deduce implicit knowledge from the
                  explicitly represented knowledge. In this thesis we
                  investigate the Proof Theory for DLs. We introduce
                  Sequent Calculi and Natural Deduction for some DLs
                  (ALC, ALCQ). Cut-elimination and Normalization are
                  proved for the calculi. It is argued that those
                  systems can improve the extraction of computational
                  content from DLs proofs for explanations purpose.},

                  S_{ALC} and S_{ALC}^{[]} for the basic Description Logic
                  (DL) ALC. Proposing Sequent Calculus (SC) for
                  dealing with DL reasoning aims to provide a more
                  structural way to generated explanations, from
                  proofs as well as counter-models, in the context of
                  Knowledge Base and Ontologies authoring tools. The
                  ability of providing short (Polynomial) proofs is
                  also considered as an advantage of {\em SC}-based
                  explanations with regard to the well-known
                  Tableaux-based reasoners. Both, S_{ALC} and S_{ALC}
                  satisfy cut-elimination, while S_{ALC}^{[]} also provides
                  ALC counter-example from unsuccessful

  abstract =    {In ubiquitous applications, where the meaning of an
                  entity, such as a user or service, depends on
                  environment-specific constraints and dynamic changes
                  in the environment have to be considered in all
                  stages of development, the separation between the
                  system's behaviour and its context representation
                  (a.k.a.\ context model) is essential for
                  facilitating the development of such inherently
                  complex systems. At the same time, because of its
                  well-known benefits, a formal specifications should
                  be considered not only for describing the system's
                  behaviour, but also the corresponding context
                  model. Considering this, we propose in this paper an
                  environment to support context modelling through
                  formal specification. For this sake, we adopt the
                  algebra of contextualized entities proposed
                  in [Comorea2008,Isola2008] and define levels of
                  abstractions over its diagrams, enabling a stepwise
                  construction of modular specifications. The overall
                  goal is to reduce the gap between the formal
                  description of an ubiquitous application and its
                  implementation.},

  year = 	{2010},
  abstract =    { Constructive modal logics come in several different
                  flavours and constructive description logics, not
                  surprisingly, do the same. We introduce an
                  intuitionistic description logic, which we call
                  \ialc\ (for intuitionistic \alc, since \alc\ is the
                  name of the canonical description logic system) and
                  provide axioms, a Natural Deduction formulation and
                  a sequent calculus for it. The system \ialc\ is
                  related to Simpson's constructive modal logic $\sf
                  IK$ the same way Mendler and Scheele's $c\cal{ALC}$
                  is related to constructive $\sf CK$ and in the same
                  way classical multimodal $\sf K$ is related to $\sf
                  ALC$. In the system \ialc, as well as in $c{\cal
                  ALC}$, the classical principles of the excluded
                  middle $C\dlor \neg C= {\sf T}$, double negation
                  $\neg \neg C=C$ and the definitions of the
                  modalities $\exists R.C= \neg \forall R. \neg C$ and
                  $\forall R.C= \neg \exists R.\neg C$ are no longer
                  validities, but simply non-trivial TBox statements
                  used to axiomatize specific application
                  scenarios. Meanwhile in \ialc, like in classical
                  $\sf ALC$, we have that the distribution of
                  existential roles over disjunction i.e. $\exists
                  R.(C\dlor D) = \exists R.C \dlor \exists R.D$ and
                  (the nullary case) $\exists R.\bot= \bot$ hold,
                  which is {\em not} true for $c{\cal ALC}$. We intend
                  to use \ialc\ for modelling juridical Artificial
                  Intelligence (AI) systems and we describe briefly
                  how.},

  abstract  =   {Constructive modal logics come in several different
                  flavours and constructive description logics, not
                  surprisingly, do the same. We introduce an
                  intuitionistic description logic, which we call iALC
                  (for intuitionistic ALC, since ALC is the name of
                  the canonical description logic system) and provide
                  axioms, a Natural Deduction formulation and a
                  sequent calculus for it. The system iALC is related
                  to Simpson's constructive modal logic IK the same
                  way Mendler and Scheele's cALC is related to
                  constructive CK and in the same way classical
                  multimodal K is related to ALC. In the system iALC,
                  as well as in cALC, the classical principles of the
                  excluded middle $ (C \sqcup \neg C) = \top $, double
                  negation $\neg\neg C=C$ and the definitions of the
                  modalities $\exists R.C = \neg \forall R.\neg C$ and
                  $\forall R.C= \neg \exists R.\neg C$ are no longer
                  validities, but simply non-trivial TBox statements
                  used to axiomatize specific application
                  scenarios. Meanwhile in iALC, like in classical ALC,
                  we have that the distribution of existential roles
                  over disjunction i.e. $\exists R.(C \sqcup D) =
                  \exists R.C \sqcup \exists R.D$ and (the nullary
                  case) $\exists R. \bot = \bot$ hold, which is not
                  true for cALC. We intend to use iALC for modelling
                  juridical Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and
                  we describe briefly how.},

  abstract = {Description Logics (DLs) is a family of formalisms used
                  to represent knowledge of a domain. They are
                  equipped with a formal logic-based
                  semantics. Knowledge representation systems based on
                  description logics provide various inference
                  capabilities that deduce implicit knowledge from the
                  explicitly represented knowledge. In this thesis we
                  investigate the Proof Theory for DLs. We introduce
                  Sequent Calculi and Natural Deduction for some DLs
                  (ALC, ALCQ). Cut-elimination and Normalization are
                  proved for the calculi. It is argued that those
                  systems can improve the extraction of computational
                  content from DLs proofs for explanations purpose.},
