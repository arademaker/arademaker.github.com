  abstract  = {Semantic role labeling (SRL) represents the meaning of a sentence in the form of predicate-argument structures. Such shallow semantic analysis is helpful in a wide range of downstream NLP tasks and real-world applications. As treebanks enabled the development of powerful syntactic parsers, the accurate predicate-argument analysis demands training data in the form of propbanks. Unfortunately, most languages simply do not have corresponding propbanks due to the high cost required to construct such resources. To overcome such challenges, Universal Proposition Bank 1.0 (UP1.0) was released in 2017, with high-quality propbank data generated via a two-stage method exploiting monolingual SRL and multilingual parallel data. In this paper, we introduce Universal Proposition Bank 2.0 (UP2.0), with significant enhancements over UP1.0: (1) propbanks with higher quality by using a state-of-the-art monolingual SRL and improved auto-generation of annotations; (2) expanded language coverage (from 7 to 9 languages); (3) span annotation for the decoupling of syntactic analysis; and (4) Gold data for a subset of the languages. We also share our experimental results that confirm the significant quality improvements of the generated propbanks. In addition, we present a comprehensive experimental evaluation on how different implementation choices impact the quality of the resulting data. We release these resources to the research community and hope to encourage more research on cross-lingual SRL.},

                  guidelines and treebanks in various

                  the updated resources maintain universality with
                  other language resources. Thus, validity and
                  consistency of multilingual corpora should be tested
                  through application tasks involving syntactic
                  structures with PoS tags, dependency labels, and
                  universal features. We apply the syntactic parsers
                  trained on UD treebanks from multiple versions (2.0
                  to 2.7) to a clause-level sentiment extractor. We
                  then analyze the relationships between attachment
                  scores of dependency parsers and performance in
                  application tasks. For future UD developments, we
                  show examples of outputs that differ depending on

                  using to speed up its manual
                  curation. OpenWordNet-PT is part of a collection of
                  wordnets for various languages, jointly described
                  and distributed through the Open MultiLingual
                  WordNet and the Global WordNet
                  Association. OpenWordnet-PT has been primarily
                  distributed, from the beginning, as RDF files along
                  with its model description in OWL, and it is freely
                  available for download. We contend the creation of
                  such large, distributed and linkable lexical
                  resources is on the cusp of revolutionizing
                  multilingual language processing to the next truly
                  semantic level. But to get there, there is a need
                  for user interfaces that allow ordinary users and
                  (not only computational) linguists to help in the
                  checking and cleaning up of the quality of the
                  resource. We present our suggestion of one such web
                  interface and describe its features supporting the
                  collaborative curation of the data. This showcases
                  the use and importance of its linked data features,
                  to keep track of information provenance during the
                  whole life-cycle of the RDF resource.},

  title = 	 {An Overview on Portuguese Nominalisation},
  abstract =     {We discuss nominalizations in Portuguese formed by
                  the suffix -ura, as pintura (painting), magistratura
                  (magistracy) and gordura (fat). We have done a
                  corpus-based description of the behavior of these
                  nominal forms and proposed a type ontology to
                  categorize them. We have parted from all the nouns
                  formed by -ura which are present in OpenWordNet-PT
                  and checked them in three famous Portuguese
                  dictionaries (Porto Dictionary, Caldas Aulete
                  Dictionary and Houaiss Dictionary). Then we analyzed
                  their use in context in Corpus Brasileiro, a corpus
                  which has more than 1 billion words extracted from
                  various textual genders. In order to offer a rich
                  description, we also tested all words formed by -ura
                  in co-predication contexts with at least three
                  native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese with no
                  knowledge of linguistic study theories to check if
                  their types could be co-predicated. Although our
                  main goal was to produce a corpus-based description
                  on those nouns, we have found few possible
                  generalizations considering the type-structure of
                  -ura forms. More than that, our tests on
                  co-predication show that may be the frequency of use
                  of a given word has a special role on the
                  acceptability of co-predication between different
                  senses of a nominalization.},

                  Portuguese. Today, the landscape has changed
                  significantly, and researchers that need access to
                  this specific kind of resource have not one, but
                  several alternatives to choose from. The present
                  article describes the wordnet-like resources
                  currently available for Portuguese. It provides some
                  context on their origin, creation approach, size and
                  license for utilization. Apart from being an obvious
                  starting point for those looking for a computational
                  resource with information on the meaning of
                  Portuguese words, this article describes the
                  resources available, compares them and lists some
                  plans for future work, sketching ideas for potential
                  collaboration between the projects described.},

                  context-aware systems. The algebra is designed to
                  support context moddeling and aims at the
                  specification of modular and scalable description of
                  arbitrarily complex systems. It takes
                  contextualization as a basic notion and proposes a
                  small set of simple and powerful operations to
                  compose and decompose contextualized entities. The
                  specification approach considers the gap between the
                  formal specification and the real application and
                  represent the specification process in three kinds
                  of diagrams variyng from the system design to the
                  complete formalization using the algebra. },

  abstract = {Description Logics (DLs) is a family of formalisms used
                  to represent knowledge of a domain. They are
                  equipped with a formal logic-based
                  semantics. Knowledge representation systems based on
                  description logics provide various inference
                  capabilities that deduce implicit knowledge from the
                  explicitly represented knowledge. In this thesis we
                  investigate the Proof Theory for DLs. We introduce
                  Sequent Calculi and Natural Deduction for some DLs
                  (ALC, ALCQ). Cut-elimination and Normalization are
                  proved for the calculi. It is argued that those
                  systems can improve the extraction of computational
                  content from DLs proofs for explanations purpose.},

  journal = 	{Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science},
  abstract  =   {Constructive modal logics come in several different
                  flavours and constructive description logics, not
                  surprisingly, do the same. We introduce an
                  intuitionistic description logic, which we call iALC
                  (for intuitionistic ALC, since ALC is the name of
                  the canonical description logic system) and provide
                  axioms, a Natural Deduction formulation and a
                  sequent calculus for it. The system iALC is related
                  to Simpson's constructive modal logic IK the same
                  way Mendler and Scheele's cALC is related to
                  constructive CK and in the same way classical
                  multimodal K is related to ALC. In the system iALC,
                  as well as in cALC, the classical principles of the
                  excluded middle $ (C \sqcup \neg C) = \top $, double
                  negation $\neg\neg C=C$ and the definitions of the
                  modalities $\exists R.C = \neg \forall R.\neg C$ and
                  $\forall R.C= \neg \exists R.\neg C$ are no longer
                  validities, but simply non-trivial TBox statements
                  used to axiomatize specific application
                  scenarios. Meanwhile in iALC, like in classical ALC,

  year = 	{2010},
  abstract =    {Description Logics (DLs) is a family of formalisms
                  used to represent knowledge of a domain. They are
                  equipped with a formal logic-based
                  semantics. Knowledge representation systems based on
                  description logics provide various inference
                  capabilities that deduce implicit knowledge from the
                  explicitly represented knowledge. In this thesis we
                  investigate the Proof Theory for DLs. We introduce
                  Sequent Calculi and Natural Deduction for some DLs
                  (ALC, ALCQ). Cut-elimination and Normalization are
                  proved for the calculi. It is argued that those
                  systems can improve the extraction of computational
                  content from DLs proofs for explanations purpose.},

  year = 	{2010},
  abstract =    { Constructive modal logics come in several different
                  flavours and constructive description logics, not
                  surprisingly, do the same. We introduce an
                  intuitionistic description logic, which we call
                  \ialc\ (for intuitionistic \alc, since \alc\ is the
                  name of the canonical description logic system) and
                  provide axioms, a Natural Deduction formulation and
                  a sequent calculus for it. The system \ialc\ is
                  related to Simpson's constructive modal logic $\sf
                  IK$ the same way Mendler and Scheele's $c\cal{ALC}$
                  is related to constructive $\sf CK$ and in the same
                  way classical multimodal $\sf K$ is related to $\sf
                  ALC$. In the system \ialc, as well as in $c{\cal
                  ALC}$, the classical principles of the excluded
                  middle $C\dlor \neg C= {\sf T}$, double negation
                  $\neg \neg C=C$ and the definitions of the
                  modalities $\exists R.C= \neg \forall R. \neg C$ and
                  $\forall R.C= \neg \exists R.\neg C$ are no longer
                  validities, but simply non-trivial TBox statements
                  used to axiomatize specific application
                  scenarios. Meanwhile in \ialc, like in classical
                  $\sf ALC$, we have that the distribution of
                  existential roles over disjunction i.e. $\exists
                  R.(C\dlor D) = \exists R.C \dlor \exists R.D$ and
                  (the nullary case) $\exists R.\bot= \bot$ hold,
                  which is {\em not} true for $c{\cal ALC}$. We intend
                  to use \ialc\ for modelling juridical Artificial
                  Intelligence (AI) systems and we describe briefly

  abstract =    {In ubiquitous applications, where the meaning of an
                  entity, such as a user or service, depends on
                  environment-specific constraints and dynamic changes
                  in the environment have to be considered in all
                  stages of development, the separation between the
                  system's behaviour and its context representation
                  (a.k.a. context model) is essential for facilitating
                  the development of such inherently complex
                  systems. At the same time, because of its well-known
                  benefits, a formal specifications should be
                  considered not only for describing the system's
                  behaviour, but also the corresponding context
                  model. Considering this, we propose in this paper an
                  environment to support context modelling through
                  formal specification. For this sake, we adopt the
                  algebra of contextualized entities proposed in
                  [Comorea2008,Isola2008] and define levels of
                  abstractions over its diagrams, enabling a stepwise
                  construction of modular specifications. The overall
                  goal is to reduce the gap between the formal
                  description of an ubiquitous application and its
                  implementation.},

                  S_{ALC} and S_{ALC}^{[]} for the basic Description Logic
                  (DL) ALC. Proposing Sequent Calculus (SC) for
                  dealing with DL reasoning aims to provide a more
                  structural way to generated explanations, from
                  proofs as well as counter-models, in the context of
                  Knowledge Base and Ontologies authoring tools. The
                  ability of providing short (Polynomial) proofs is
                  also considered as an advantage of {\em SC}-based
                  explanations with regard to the well-known
                  Tableaux-based reasoners. Both, S_{ALC} and S_{ALC}
                  satisfy cut-elimination, while S_{ALC}^{[]} also provides
