                  created, manually curated wordnet for Portuguese and
                  introduces the newly developed web interface we are
                  using to speed up its manual
                  curation. OpenWordNet-PT is part of a collection of
                  wordnets for various languages, jointly described
                  and distributed through the Open MultiLingual
                  WordNet and the Global WordNet
                  Association. OpenWordnet-PT has been primarily
                  distributed, from the beginning, as RDF files along
                  with its model description in OWL, and it is freely
                  available for download. We contend the creation of
                  such large, distributed and linkable lexical
                  resources is on the cusp of revolutionizing
                  multilingual language processing to the next truly
                  semantic level. But to get there, there is a need
                  for user interfaces that allow ordinary users and
                  (not only computational) linguists to help in the
                  checking and cleaning up of the quality of the
                  resource. We present our suggestion of one such web
                  interface and describe its features supporting the
                  collaborative curation of the data. This showcases
                  the use and importance of its linked data features,
                  to keep track of information provenance during the
                  whole life-cycle of the RDF resource.},

  title = 	 {An Overview on Portuguese Nominalisation},
  abstract =     {We discuss nominalizations in Portuguese formed by
                  the suffix -ura, as pintura (painting), magistratura
                  (magistracy) and gordura (fat). We have done a
                  corpus-based description of the behavior of these
                  nominal forms and proposed a type ontology to
                  categorize them. We have parted from all the nouns
                  formed by -ura which are present in OpenWordNet-PT
                  and checked them in three famous Portuguese
                  dictionaries (Porto Dictionary, Caldas Aulete
                  Dictionary and Houaiss Dictionary). Then we analyzed
                  their use in context in Corpus Brasileiro, a corpus
                  which has more than 1 billion words extracted from
                  various textual genders. In order to offer a rich
                  description, we also tested all words formed by -ura
                  in co-predication contexts with at least three
                  native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese with no
                  knowledge of linguistic study theories to check if
                  their types could be co-predicated. Although our
                  main goal was to produce a corpus-based description
                  on those nouns, we have found few possible
                  generalizations considering the type-structure of
                  -ura forms. More than that, our tests on
                  co-predication show that may be the frequency of use
                  of a given word has a special role on the
                  acceptability of co-predication between different
                  senses of a nominalization.},

@article{wordnets:2015,
  Abstract = {Not many years ago it was usual to comment on the lack
                  of an open lexical-semantic knowledge base,
                  following the lines of Princeton WordNet, but for
                  Portuguese. Today, the landscape has changed
                  significantly, and researchers that need access to
                  this specific kind of resource have not one, but
                  several alternatives to choose from. The present
                  article describes the wordnet-like resources
                  currently available for Portuguese. It provides some
                  context on their origin, creation approach, size and
                  license for utilization. Apart from being an obvious
                  starting point for those looking for a computational
                  resource with information on the meaning of
                  Portuguese words, this article describes the
                  resources available, compares them and lists some
                  plans for future work, sketching ideas for potential
                  collaboration between the projects described.},

                  contextualized ontologies and an approach to specify
                  context-aware systems. The algebra is designed to
                  support context moddeling and aims at the
                  specification of modular and scalable description of
                  arbitrarily complex systems. It takes
                  contextualization as a basic notion and proposes a
                  small set of simple and powerful operations to
                  compose and decompose contextualized entities. The
                  specification approach considers the gap between the
                  formal specification and the real application and
                  represent the specification process in three kinds
                  of diagrams variyng from the system design to the
                  complete formalization using the algebra. },

                  are closely related to a given topic, an ontology

  title = 	{Designing ubiquitous applications: proposal of a specification environment},
  abstract =    {In ubiquitous applications, where the meaning of an
                  entity, such as a user or service, depends on
                  environment-specific constraints and dynamic changes
                  in the environment have to be considered in all
                  stages of development, the separation between the
                  system's behaviour and its context representation
                  (a.k.a. context model) is essential for facilitating
                  the development of such inherently complex
                  systems. At the same time, because of its well-known
                  benefits, a formal specifications should be
                  considered not only for describing the system's
                  behaviour, but also the corresponding context
                  model. Considering this, we propose in this paper an
                  environment to support context modelling through
                  formal specification. For this sake, we adopt the
                  algebra of contextualized entities proposed in
                  [Comorea2008,Isola2008] and define levels of
                  abstractions over its diagrams, enabling a stepwise
                  construction of modular specifications. The overall
                  goal is to reduce the gap between the formal
                  description of an ubiquitous application and its
                  implementation.},

  booktitle = 	{Advances in Artificial Intelligence - SBIA 2008},
  year = 	{2008},
  abstract =    {This article presents labelled sequent calculi
                  S_{ALC} and S_{ALC}^{[]} for the basic Description Logic
                  (DL) ALC. Proposing Sequent Calculus (SC) for
                  dealing with DL reasoning aims to provide a more
                  structural way to generated explanations, from
                  proofs as well as counter-models, in the context of
                  Knowledge Base and Ontologies authoring tools. The
                  ability of providing short (Polynomial) proofs is
                  also considered as an advantage of {\em SC}-based
                  explanations with regard to the well-known
                  Tableaux-based reasoners. Both, S_{ALC} and S_{ALC}
                  satisfy cut-elimination, while S_{ALC}^{[]} also provides
                  ALC counter-example from unsuccessful
                  proof-trees. Some suggestions for extracting
                  explanations from proofs in the presented systems is
                  also discussed.  Keywords: description logics,
