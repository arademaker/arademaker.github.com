================

In ubiquitous applications, where the meaning of an entity, such as a
user or service, depends on environment-specific constraints and
dynamic changes in the environment have to be considered in all stages
of development, the separation between the system's behaviour and its
context representation (a.k.a. context model) is essential for
facilitating the development of such inherently complex systems. At
the same time, because of its well-known benefits, a formal
specifications should be considered not only for describing the
system's behaviour, but also the corresponding context
model. Considering this, we propose in this paper an environment to
support context modelling through formal specification. For this sake,
we adopt the algebra of contextualized entities proposed and define
levels of abstractions over its diagrams, enabling a stepwise
construction of modular specifications. The overall goal is to reduce
the gap between the formal description of an ubiquitous application
and its implementation.
