================

Description Logics is a family of formalisms used to represent
knowledge of a domain. In con- trast with others knowledge
representation systems, Description Logics are equipped with a formal,
logic-based semantics. Knowledge representation systems based on
description logics provide various inference capabilities that deduce
implicit knowledge from the explicitly represented knowledge.  In "A
sequent calculus for alc" we present a sequent calculus for ALC , a
basic Description Logic, called SALC . The first motivation for
developing such system is the extraction of computational content of
ALC proofs. The present calculus is an intermediate step towards a
Natural Deduction System for ALC . In this paper we present the proof
of cut elimination for SALC .
