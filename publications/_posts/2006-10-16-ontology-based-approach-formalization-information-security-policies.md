================

We present the structure of an ontology for Information Security (IS)
and discuss a paradigm whereby it can be used to extract knowledge
from natural language texts such as IS standards, security policies
and security control descriptions. Besides providing a vocabulary for
the IS domain, the proposed ontology stores logical forms
corresponding to statements in the text, as well as a set of axioms
used for inference in description logic (DL). We also describe a tool
to provide automatic support for the formalization process.
