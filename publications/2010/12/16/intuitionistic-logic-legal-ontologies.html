<h1>Intuitionistic Logic and Legal Ontologies</h1>

<p>Classical Description Logic has been widely used as a basis for
ontology creation and reasoning in many knowledge specific
domains. These specific domains naturally include Legal AI. As in any
other domain, consistency is an important issue for legal ontologies.
However, due to its inherently normative feature, coherence
(consistency) in legal ontologies is more subtle than in most other
domains. Negation and subsumption play a central role in ontology
coherence. An adequate intuitionistic semantics for negation in a
legal domain comes to the fore when we take legally valid individual
statements as the inhabitants of our legal ontology.</p>
