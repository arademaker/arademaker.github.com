<h1>Ontology and Context</h1>

<p>This paper considers a formal framework to contextualize ontologies
and presents a formal algebra to manipulate these entities providing
several ways of composing ontologies, contexts or both. The algebra
gives the flexibility that is required to model applications where the
meaning of an entity depends on environment constraints or where
dynamic changes in the environment must be considered.</p>
