<h1>A Formal Framework for Modeling Context-Aware Behavior in Ubiquitous Computing</h1>

<p>A formal framework to contextualize ontologies, proposed in [3],
provides several ways of composing ontologies, contexts or both. The
proposed algebra can be used to model applications in which the
meaning of an entity depends on environment constraints or where
dynamic changes in the environment have to be considered. In this
article we use this algebra to formalize the problem of interpreting
context information in ubiquitous systems, based on a concrete
scenario. The main goal is to verify, on one hand, how the formal
approach can contribute with a better understanding of the fundamental
concepts of ubiquitous computing and, on the other hand, if this
formal framework is flexible and rich enough to adequately express
specific characteristics of the concrete application domain and
scenario.</p>
