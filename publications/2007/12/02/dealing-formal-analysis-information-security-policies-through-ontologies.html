<h1>Dealing with the Formal Analysis of Information Security Policies through Ontologies. A Case Study</h1>

<p>We present the structure of an ontology for Information Security (IS),
applied to the extraction of knowledge from Natural Language texts (IS
standards, security policies and security control descriptions). This
ontology is com- posed of the vocabulary for the IS Domain, and a
partic- ular kind of ontology description, logical forms to deter-
mine the structure of the DL formulas associated with the texts. We
also discuss the relationship between the struc- ture of the formulas
and the efficiency of the reasoner.</p>
