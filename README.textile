h1. This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

My site is inspired by Tom Preston-Werner's website. Actually, I have
forked his site and insert my content. My options to move my website
and blog to Github are, somehow, the same as Tom. He said and I
completely agree:

bq. I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on
some remote server. That is backwards. I've lost valuable posts that
way. I want to author my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog
should be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. It should
take care of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should
be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data again.
