<p>
The introduction of this papers is fascinating. The complementarity
mentioned in the introduction has been in my mind for a while:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In recent years, the complementarity of distributional and formal
semantics has become increasingly evident&#x2026; A number of proposals
have emerged from these considerations, suggesting that an overarching
semantics integrating both distributional and formal aspects would be
desirable&#x2026;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another interesting part of the paper is its section 4.2, when the
authors introduce their definition of 'model-theoretic spaces':
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Ontologies can be represented in various ways, but in this paper, we
assume they are formalised in terms of sets of entities&#x2026; In our
account, we do not have an a priori model of the world: we wish to
infer it from our observation of language data
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the next paragraphs, the authors precisely defined their
'model-theoretic spaces'. The article is worth to reading.
