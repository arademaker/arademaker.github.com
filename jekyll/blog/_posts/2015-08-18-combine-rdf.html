title: Merging RDF files

<p>
How to merge multiple RDF files into a single RDF file? The first idea
would be to convert each RDF file in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/RDFCore/ntriples/">ntriples</a> and just concatenate
them using unix <code>cat</code> utility, right? No, it doesn't work with blank
nodes (or BNodes)! BNodes from different files with the same ID would
be merged as a single resource and this is not the expected semantics,
BNodes from different files are different resources, even if they have
the same id.
</p>

<p>
The <code>rapper</code> is a utility from the package <a href="http://librdf.org">Redland</a>. Below I am
presented the files and the number of triples on each one.
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ rapper -c -i ntriples wordnet-en-fixed.nt
rapper: Parsing returned 3517504 triples

$ rapper -c -i ntriples own-pt-fixed.nt
rapper: Parsing returned  824916 triples
</pre>

<p>
The oldest tool to support merging of RDF files is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm.html">CWM</a>. CWM is written
in python and its performance is really bad. The command below hasn't
finish after 5 minutes. 
</p>

<pre class="example">
/usr/local/cwm-1.2.1/cwm --ntriples own-pt-fixed.nt wordnet-en-fixed.nt &gt; tudo-cwm.nt
</pre>

<p>
Next tool that I tried was <a href="http://rdfpro.fbk.eu">\(RDF_{pro}\)</a>. The performance was excellent,
only 11 seconds! But we must add a parameter <code>-w</code> to force BNodes in
input files to be renamed to avoid possible clashes. Actually, it
doesn't make sense to me why this is not the default behaviour.
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ rdfpro @r -w own-pt-fixed.nt wordnet-en-fixed.nt @w tudo-pro.nt
14:45:53(I) 4342420 triples read (377077 tr/s avg)
14:45:53(I) 4342420 triples written (377077 tr/s avg)
14:45:53(I) Done in 11 s
</pre>

<p>
Next tool, <code>riot</code> from the <a href="https://jena.apache.org">Jena</a> library. The performance was not bad,
it took twice the time of \(RDF_{pro}\) but it finished. The only
problem is that it complained about some IRI that no other tool
complained.
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ time riot own-pt-fixed.nt wordnet-en-fixed.nt &gt; tudo-riot.nt
14:51:14 WARN riot :: [line: 282756, col: 1 ] Bad IRI: &lt;https://w3id.org/own-pt/wn30-pt/instances/word-Ĳsselmeer&gt; Code: 47/NOT_NFKC in PATH: The IRI is not in Unicode Normal Form KC.
14:51:14 WARN riot :: [line: 282756, col: 1 ] Bad IRI: &lt;https://w3id.org/own-pt/wn30-pt/instances/word-Ĳsselmeer&gt; Code: 56/COMPATIBILITY_CHARACTER in PATH: Bad character

<p>
I don't like warnnings so I tried the safe path. I converted the
ntriple file with these strange IRIs to RDF/XML and called <code>riot</code>
again. No warnnings this time, good!
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ rapper -i ntriples -o rdfxml own-pt-fixed.nt  &gt; own-pt-fixed.rdf
rapper: Serializing with serializer rdfxml
rapper: Parsing returned 824916 triples

$ riot --time own-pt-fixed.rdf wordnet-en-fixed.nt &gt; tudo-riot.nt
own-pt-fixed.rdf : 14.84 sec  824,916 triples  55,602.32 TPS
wordnet-en-fixed.nt : 21.82 sec  3,517,504 triples  161,175.95 TPS
Total : 36.66 sec  4,342,420 triples  118,451.17 TPS
</pre>

<p>
But the output produced does have some errors! The IRIs are not
encoded as the way the ntriples specification requires.
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ rapper -c -i ntriples tudo-riot.nt

rapper: Parsing URI tudo-riot.nt with parser ntriples
rapper: Error - URI tudo-riot.nt:117668 column 55 - Non-printable ASCII character 195 (0xC3) found.
rapper: Error - URI tudo-riot.nt:117668 column 56 - Non-printable ASCII character 162 (0xA2) found.
</pre>

<p>
By the way, for the future, I will use \(RDF_pro\).
