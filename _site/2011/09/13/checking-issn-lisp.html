<h1>Verifying check digit of ISSN</h1>

<p>The code below is my first approach to create a lisp function that test the ISSN <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_digit'>check digit</a>. Unfortunately, the code runs only in Allegro CL due the requirement of regexp2 library. Since the regexp2 library is easly replaced by an opensource regexp library, this is not a real constraint.</p>
