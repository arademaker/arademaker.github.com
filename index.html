<p>In April 2010 I obtained my PhD at <a href="http://www.puc-rio.br">PUC-Rio</a>.
My advisor was <a href="http://www.tecmf.inf.puc-rio.br/~hermann/">Edward Hermann
Haeusler</a>. My research
areas are <a href="http://dl.kr.org/">Description Logics</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory">Proof
Theory</a>. Currently, I am a
professor at <a href="http://emap.fgv.br">Applied Math School at Getulio Vargas Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>During my PhD I had two outstanding experiences as International
fellow at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/people.html">MS
Research</a>,
between April and July of 2008 and at <a href="http://www.sri.com/">SRI
International</a>, between February and July of
2009.</p>
