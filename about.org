Alexandre has a doctorate in Computer Science from [[http://www.inf.puc-rio.br][PUC-Rio]] (2010). He
is a research scientist in [[http://researcher.ibm.com/person/br-alexrad ][IBM Research]] (Brazil Lab) and adjunct
professor at the [[http://emap.fgv.br][Applied Mathematics Department]] from Getulio Vargas
Foundation (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).  He has written more than 90
papers published in peer-reviewed journals and international
conferences in his areas of expertise: logic, proof theory, knowledge
representation and reasoning, language resources, computational
linguistics, and type theory. He participates as a member of many
program committees of regular conferences like ACL, COLING, LREC, and
others. He is also a board member of the Global WordNet Association
and coordinated the [[http://cepln.github.io][CE-PLN]] between 2017-219. Alexandre collaborates
on maintaining many language resources and developing applications
using these resources for 'deep' linguistic processing of human
languages.

During his Ph.D., Alexandre was an international fellow at Microsoft
Research and SRI International. At MSR, in 2008, he worked with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_Theorem_Prover][Z3
SMT Solver]] team (Leonardo de Moura and Nikolaj Bj√∏rner) developing a
distributed environment for testing and optimizations of Z3. At [[http://www.sri.com/][SRI
International]], in 2009, he worked under the supervision of Natarajan
Shankar. Alexandre participated in several research projects like MIST
(using natural language processing and description logics for
Knowledge modeling), ANUBIS (database consistency check) and Ontology
and Context (investigating the problem of ontology alignment). In his
thesis, we proposed new deduction systems for description logics under
the supervision of Edward Hermann Haeusler, published by Springer with
the title [[https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Description-SpringerBriefs-Computer-Science-ebook/dp/B00A9YGJR0][A proof theory for Description Logics]] in 2012 in the
Springer Briefs series.
