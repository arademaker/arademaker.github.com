================

In April 2010 I obtained my PhD at [PUC-Rio](http://www.puc-rio.br).
My advisor was [Edward Hermann Haeusler](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~hermann/). My research
areas are [Description Logics](http://dl.kr.org/) and [Proof Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_theory). 
Currently, I am a professor at [Applied Math School at Getulio Vargas Foundation](http://emap.fgv.br).

During my PhD I had two outstanding experiences as International
fellow at [MS Research](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/people.html),
between April and July of 2008 and at [SRI International](http://www.sri.com/), between February and July of
2009.
